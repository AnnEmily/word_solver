# Word game solver

This app will help to solve word games, such as NY Times [Wordle](https://www.nytimes.com/games/wordle/index.html), [Grid Games](https://gridgames.app/gridwords/) and others.

The app provides a list of words matching the constraints of the words entered so far in the game panel:
- letter not in word
- letter in word but in the wrong place
- letter in word and in the right place

Word lists are available in four languages: English, French, Spanish and German.
<!-- Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) (or [oxc](https://oxc.rs) when used in [rolldown-vite](https://vite.dev/guide/rolldown)) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## React Compiler

The React Compiler is not enabled on this template because of its impact on dev & build performances. To add it, see [this documentation](https://react.dev/learn/react-compiler/installation).
